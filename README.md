# lab-ccna
Hello, These are most of my Labs from when I was studying for CCNA.
I created them so I could go back and reference these in the future.
You will need Cisco Packet Tracer to view the .pkt files. Overtime I've changed some of the way to view them.
They go in number order and build off of each other.
