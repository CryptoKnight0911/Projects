# My Labs
These are some of my Labs from when I was studying for CCNA.
I created them so I could go back and reference these in the future.
You will need Cisco Packet Tracer to view the .pkt files. There is no
exact order to view them. (Note) I couldn't get the WLC to work properly 
in packet tracer, it kept getting stuck at the https:// login screen.
Also Dynamic NAT, doesn't work either, at least on the 2911 router.
