# My Labs
These are some of my Labs from when I was studying for CCNA.
I created them so I could go back and reference these in the future.
You will need Cisco Packet Tracer to view the .pkt files. There is no
exact order to view them and feel free to work on any and use them for 
yourself. 

My next lab I'm creating in Azure.
